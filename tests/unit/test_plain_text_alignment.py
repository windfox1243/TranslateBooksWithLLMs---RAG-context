"""
Regression tests for issue #203: Plain Text Mode paragraph realignment.

The reassembly step must keep a 1:1 mapping between source and translated
paragraph indices, even when:
- (a) the source contains empty paragraphs (image-only blocks create "" slots);
- (b) a single paragraph exceeds max_tokens and is split into sentence chunks.

Before the fix, both cases shifted every subsequent paragraph by one or more
slots (headings got body text, images anchored after the wrong paragraph,
bilingual mode paired source i with translation i+1).
