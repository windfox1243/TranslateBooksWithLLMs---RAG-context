"""
Per-session API token authentication (issue #210).

The web server has no user accounts; its only legitimate client is the SPA it
serves to the same origin. Before this layer, wildcard CORS plus the absence of
any auth let any website the user visited issue cross-origin requests to the
local API and read/trigger file-read, file-management, settings-write and
self-update endpoints (drive-by attacks).

The fix has two halves:

1. CORS is no longer permissive (see translation_api.py): the wildcard
   ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` is gone and Socket.IO falls back to its
   same-origin default. A foreign page can therefore no longer *read* responses.

2. This module adds a secret, per-process token that gates every ``/api/`` route
   and the Socket.IO handshake. The token is minted at startup, handed to the
   SPA inside the HTML page (which is same-origin, so a foreign page cannot read
   it), and replayed by the client on every request. A cross-origin attacker can
   neither read the token nor forge the custom header it travels in, which also
   closes the CSRF vector for "simple" requests that CORS alone does not block.

The token is regenerated on each server start; it is never persisted.
